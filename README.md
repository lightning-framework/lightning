# Lightning

A simple yet expressive web framework for Java built on Jetty.

Our design goals are...

  * To provide the convenience of PHP-style save-and-refresh development in Java
  * To make web development simple for beginners by having simple, expressive APIs
  * To provide core HTTP functionality while giving developers complete freedom in choosing
    how to manage the other components of their applications such as db, email, cache,
    users/groups, auth, json, templates, etc.

This framework was written for use in a course I taught at Rice University.
